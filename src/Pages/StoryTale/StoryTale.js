            The experience takes place between a parent and their child on a
            tablet. The parent or child selects a story they want to read from
            the story selection page.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The app keeps track of whatâ€™s being read and listens for key
            words. When a pre-specified keyword is said (e.g. "cow"), a relevant
            3D model appears in AR to which the users will be able to interact
            with.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Parents or children can then have simple interactions with the 3D
            model. For example, they can tap a cow to hear it "moo".

            Allows for the parents to be apart of the story experience with
            their child. Dictation can also help kids who struggle with reading
            and writing.

            Below is an example of how voice recogntion is introduced to
            children.

            There is a narrative potential in using AR to tell stories. Rather
            than having stories take shape in a book, the story is instead
            placed in their own space.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            This creates a more realistic and seamless experience by using the
            lens of the device.
